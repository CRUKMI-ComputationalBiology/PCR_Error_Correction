# PCR Error Correction (PEC) algorithm

## Introduction:

Circulating-free DNA (cfDNA) profiling by sequencing is an important minimally invasive protocol to monitor the mutation profile of solid tumours in cancer patients. Since the concentration of available cfDNA is limited, sample library generation relies on multiple rounds of PCR amplification, during which the accumulation of errors results in reduced sensitivity and lower accuracy. PCR Error Correction (PEC) is a novel algorithm that exploits the redundancy in sequencing data to reduce both sequencing and PCR errors. When used in a Single Nucleotide Variant (SNV) detection pipeline, this leads to a substantial increase in sensitivity over current approaches.
